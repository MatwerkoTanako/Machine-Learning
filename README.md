# Machine learning
This repo exists to help me understand machine learning is and find some uses to it. I don't have internet at the moment so all of this is based on scarch and idk im just rolling with the punches. I hope that my computer already has the necessary librares that would make this work.
## C++
I have heard that C++ is great for memory efficiency and speed, so maybe more intensive things can go in this folder. For now tho, I need to learn how to use C in the [Introduction](.\C++\Introduction) folder, Later on ill probably make a machine learning learning folder and a dedicated projects folder.
## Golang
GO or formerly Golang, was developed by google and has a C-esque syntax hat is apparently efficient and great for cloud computing.  I think this would be great for applications with lots of data that I pull from the internet, though I still need to learn how to do that. For now, the [Introductions](.\golang\Introduction) folder will go through some of the same basic steps as the C++ directory in rdr to learn the language.
## Python
Python is a simple language with lots of machine learning support and packagages made solely for that purpose. Therefore, I think it is a great starting point to learn how machine learning works. I will propbably be using the MIT ocw lessons to supplement my work but that's probably it before I start making my own stuff. I have a lot to learn still.
